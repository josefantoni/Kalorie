# Kalorie — TODO

## Planned features

- **Support development (tips)** — designed in [design 0023](docs/design/0023-support-development-tips.md) and
  implemented on both platforms and switched off by `Constants.Tips.isEnabled`, so the apps ship without
  tips. Blocked on the owner's trade licence being suspended: income from the stores
  likely counts as business income, so decide with an accountant before enabling. To enable: renew the
  licence, create the Play payments profile and the three consumable products (`tip_small`, `tip_medium`,
  `tip_large`), accept the App Store Connect *Paid Apps* agreement and create the same products (neutral
  names, Czech + English descriptions), switch the App Store Connect DSA status from *not a trader* to *trader* (an address, phone and email are then published on the product page) and make the Play listing consistent, then set `Constants.Tips.isEnabled` / `IS_ENABLED` to `true` on both platforms and restore the tips paragraph in
  `backend/hosting/privacy.html` (Apple / Google process the payment, the app receives no card or purchase
  data) and test a real purchase from Internal testing with a license tester.
- **Dashboard read cost** — not urgent. Firestore bills per document read, and the dominant cost is the
  whole-month `foodConsumed` load on cold launch and pull to refresh
  ([ADR 0015](docs/adr/0015-dashboard-caches-a-month-and-derives-the-day.md)): ~300 documents per load at
  ~10 entries a day. Foreground returns, saves, deletes and copies already reload one day only
  ([ADR 0041](docs/adr/0041-dashboard-reloads-only-the-affected-day-after-a-write-or-foreground.md)). A rough
  estimate for 300 active users (2 cold launches a day) is ~180,000 month-load reads a day, i.e. about
  1.5–2 USD a month above the free tier. Revisit if the user count grows by orders of magnitude. The
  cheapest cut then is loading only the selected day on cold launch and the month lazily (about −75 % of
  reads, but the calendar dots arrive late); a per-month `activeDays` document would give the dots for
  1 read but must be kept in sync on every write. A snapshot listener does not help (resume tokens last
  ~30 minutes).
