# Kalorie — TODO

## Planned features

- **Support development (tips)** — designed in [design 0023](docs/design/0023-support-development-tips.md) and
  implemented on both platforms and switched off by `Constants.Tips.isEnabled`, so the apps ship without
  tips. Blocked on the owner's trade licence being suspended: income from the stores
  likely counts as business income, so decide with an accountant before enabling. To enable: renew the
  licence, create the Play payments profile and the three consumable products (`tip_small`, `tip_medium`,
  `tip_large`), accept the App Store Connect *Paid Apps* agreement and create the same products (neutral
  names, Czech + English descriptions), switch the App Store Connect DSA status from *not a trader* to *trader* (an address, phone and email are then published on the product page) and make the Play listing consistent, then set `Constants.Tips.isEnabled` / `IS_ENABLED` to `true` on both platforms and restore the tips paragraph in
  `backend/hosting/privacy.html` (Apple / Google process the payment, the app receives no card or purchase
  data) and test a real purchase from Internal testing with a license tester.
- **Basal metabolic rate (opt-in)** — not designed yet; write a design doc first (Scope: Cross-platform).
  Decisions taken so far: the app offers to estimate the user's BMR (sex, age, height, weight) and the
  dashboard then shows the day's kcal total against it. The offer is never automatic: it reuses the
  [design 0017](docs/design/0017-sign-in-spotlight.md) spotlight and repeats the same way until the user
  enters the data. The inputs are stored in Firestore under `users/{userId}`, so they follow the account
  across devices. Open points for the design doc: `ARCHITECTURE.md` § 944 states there are no goals or
  targets in the app, so this introduces the first one (decide whether to compare against BMR alone or
  against total daily expenditure with an activity level); the formula (Mifflin-St Jeor) belongs in a
  shared KMP module next to `MacroKit`; `users/{userId}` is currently written only by the Apple sign-in
  use case and uses camelCase; health data is a new category, so `backend/hosting/privacy.html`, App
  Privacy (App Store Connect), Data safety (Play), the Firestore rules and account deletion all need
  updating; the spotlight needs a second, independent "last shown" state. Weight: do not add a weight
  field to `users/{userId}`. [Design 0028](docs/design/0028-body-weight-tracking.md) makes
  `users/{userId}/bodyWeights` the single source of the user's weight; BMR reads "the weight valid
  today" with the same query the Dashboard circle uses and stores none of its own.
- **Propagate catalogue name and photo changes into users' copies — rollout** — the function, indexes,
  tests and docs ([ADR 0049](docs/adr/0049-catalogue-names-and-photos-propagate-into-users-copies.md),
  [design 0032](docs/design/0032-propagating-catalogue-changes.md)) are implemented in `backend/functions`.
  Left for the owner:
  - Deploy: indexes first (wait until built), then `firebase deploy --only functions` from `backend/`.
  - One-off prod fix of `foodItems/8593803625270` (re-saving it in the editor does not fire the function):
    run `propagate(db, "8593803625270", null, <current item data>)` once with gcloud credentials, only for
    this id and only with the owner's approval.
- **Dashboard read cost** — not urgent. Firestore bills per document read, and the dominant cost is the
  whole-month `foodConsumed` load on cold launch and pull to refresh
  ([ADR 0015](docs/adr/0015-dashboard-caches-a-month-and-derives-the-day.md)): ~300 documents per load at
  ~10 entries a day. Foreground returns, saves, deletes and copies already reload one day only
  ([ADR 0041](docs/adr/0041-dashboard-reloads-only-the-affected-day-after-a-write-or-foreground.md)). A rough
  estimate for 300 active users (2 cold launches a day) is ~180,000 month-load reads a day, i.e. about
  1.5–2 USD a month above the free tier. Revisit if the user count grows by orders of magnitude. The
  cheapest cut then is loading only the selected day on cold launch and the month lazily (about −75 % of
  reads, but the calendar dots arrive late); a per-month `activeDays` document would give the dots for
  1 read but must be kept in sync on every write. A snapshot listener does not help (resume tokens last
  ~30 minutes).
